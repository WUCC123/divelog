Dive Logbook
============

Elgg Diver Communities of the World, we got you covered!



Allow you to record dives in a logbook and share them with friends.


# Features #

The current logbook records basic dive data such as dive site, duration, depth reached, dive buddies,
and whether pictures or videos were taken.
The module can easily be extended to record additional information.

When a dive buddy is an Elgg user, it appears as a link to his or her logbook.

The divelog module may be integrated with two other modules: event_calendar and hypeGallery.


# Sample Files #

There are 3 sample files to check dive upload.

- Sample1 is the minimum file.
- Sample2 is closer to realistic csv dive logbook.
- Sample3 does not have a heading line, so all fields are prensent and required order.
